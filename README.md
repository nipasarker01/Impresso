A React Native App


This is an Unique idea,the app will have few features with react native components.Along with react native the backend will be Firebase and mbox.
Would like to use React navigator too.

List of Features:
1.Post scene..where people can post their ideas.I would like to use few react native code like <ImagePicker> or <TouchableOpacity>
2.Login scene..login with email and also with Facebook and Google or Linkedin
3.Signup Scene..same as login
4.Match/search Scene.. where people can search the existing ideas.
